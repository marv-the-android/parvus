Program structure (of rover)

Main.py (Main system file)
>>> Startup
	>> Motor and Capture libraries are imported
	>> 433MHz transceiver library imported
	>> Transceiver SPI connection initialized
	>> Command library is declared
		> Holds relationship between plaintext commands are appropriate program functions
	>> Broadcasts "Ready to receive)
>>> Main event loop
	>> Checks for commands from base station
		> Commands are sent in batches from base station with start and stop signals
		> Commands are validated against internal command library and saved to list if valid
		> Recieves commands until stop signal is registered
	>> Commands list has been generated
		> List operates like a queue
		> First In, First Out
	>> For each item in list
		> Plaintext command is fetched from list and checked against library for relevant command
		> Relevant command is run with paramters passed from plaintext
		> Command is purged from list and loop occurs again with next command
