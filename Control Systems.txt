PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)

It consists of a signal that pulses between high and low.
The pulse width as a fraction of the total signal period is known as a duty cycle.
If a 180 degree servo had a control signal with a period of 1 seconds and the pulse lasted for 0.5 of a second then the duty cycle would be 50%.
On a 180 degree servo a duty cycle of 50% would ideally cause the servo to turn to 90 degrees.
Another thing about PWM is that because its a pulsed control signal it uses less energy and therefore leads to a more efficient system.

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
SPI is a type of synchronus data transmission. It utilises seperate transmission lines for the data and a "clock".
The clock is a pulsed signal that ideally keeps both sides of the transmission environment perfectly synchronised.

Used by:
	-Radio Transceiver

UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)
UART is actually the name of the circuit within a microcontroller and it operates on serial communication protocol
UART allows serial communcation between two devices.
In the case of the rover it will be used for providing a connection between the rover and computer via a USB port.

Used by:
	-Debug port
