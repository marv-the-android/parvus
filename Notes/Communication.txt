>>> Initial Testing
	>> Two main contenders for communcation in unlicensed commercial equipment

		> 2.4GHz
		Positives:
			-High speed
			-Very common and a lot of models/types
			-Reliable
			-Error correction
			-Can be long range but requires direction antennas and some advanced modifications (Directional antennas would require tracking of target)
		Drawbacks:
			-Not particularly long range
			-Not open source

		> 433MHz
		Positives:
			-Open source and compatible with Arduino/Raspberry Pi
			-Libraries allow for error correction
			-Reasonably long range out-of-box
			-Lower power compared to 2.4GHz
		Drawbacks:
			-VERY slow (~60 bytes/second)
			-No real time comms (Not important for the rover as commands are sent in sets and executed)

	>> 433MHz is the best choice
	>> Speed and real time comms are not as important as longer range and lower power

>>> Comms Hardware and software
	>> Using adafruit 433MHz radio transceiver board.
	>> This is a board designed around the HopeRF RFM69HCW chip but with added utilities
		> Contains voltage protection
		> Easy to connect due to pin outputs
		> Voltage switching for GPIO pins
			- 3.3v (Pi Zero)
			- 5v (Arduino)
	>> Uses SPI(Serial Peripheral Interface)
	>> Adafruit supply a python library for communication
