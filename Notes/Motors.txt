Initial research was into different types of motors available

AC motors are ruled out as the power source is DC

Intially cosidered brushless motors as these are highly resilient to wear and breaking down. Good for mars where there is no way for repairs.

However, brushless are expensive and typically require higher voltages and currents to run as well as more complex and larger control boards.

Research moved to simple, brushed DC motors.

Small geared motors are available in a variety of ratios. These allow for high torque in a small form factor.
I chose 6 298:1 gear motors as these give good torque with a slight reduction on max velocity (speed isn't too important).

Rover would have a rocker bogie suspension with each strut terminating in a motor. Front and back motors would be individually controlled by servos.

I decided I would use MG90S 14g servos as these contain metal gears over the plastic SG90 9g servos. Servos can be controlled directly by signals from the Raspberry Pi zero.

To control the main motors I need a motor driver board. There are a wide range of boards available across a massive price range but I chose the L298N driver.
Its a well known technology and packs of 5 can be picked up from Amazon for ~Â£8.

Testing of motors with the driver board went well and speed was successfully controlled through a PWM (Pulse width modulation) signal from a Raspberry Pi.

Some further research revealed that the L298N is an old design so, despite being cheap and reliable, it is very inefficient when compared to more modern designs.
Future prototypes may swap L298N for a more efficient chip such as TB6612.
