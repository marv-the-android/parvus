Rover will capture an image with its camera, encode and transmit back to base station

Started testing with a generic webcam and python OpenCV (Computer Vision) library that allows for capture and manipulation of photos


A typical high definition photo (~5MB) would take around 23 hours to transmit so the images captured by the rover must be modified
This is because the 433MHz radio transceiver can only transmit a 60-byte packet every second

But, with OpenCV I can crop captured images to a smaller resoulation (i.e. from 1080x1920 to 100x100) as well as converting to greyscale; furthing reducing file size
Modified images are about 10KB in size and take around 2.5 minutes to transmit (althoug this would increase if error checking were to be enabled)

I have successfully transmitted images in this way over a range of distances although sometimes a image needs to be sent more than one if an error has occurred.


One goal is to have the resolution of the image be user defined at a base station terminal
When an image capture command is recieved the rover would calculate file size and transfer time and relay this to the user in order to recieve confirmation

In the final design the rover's camera would be a Raspberry Pi compatible camera that connects through a designated camera slot on the Pi itself
I also intend to have the camera mounted on a servo controlled pivot to allow a wider viewing range
