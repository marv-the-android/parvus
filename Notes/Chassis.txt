>>> Chassis components are mostly 3D-printed or laser cut
	>> Designed in fusion 360
	>> Ender 5 pro 3D Printer

>>> Main "Casing"
	>> Lasercut 3mm Acrylic sheets
		> Screw holes
			- Control board standoffs
			- Standoffs for seperating top and bottom acrylic
		> Points for cable managment
			- Loop cable tie through wires and small hole in acrylic
		> Access for motor and servo wires in bottom sheet
>>> Camera mount
	>> Attached to servo to allow left/right movement of field of view
	>> Servo attached to top acrylic via screws
>>> Rocker bogie (Old)
	>> 3mm acrylic
		> Acrylic doesn't produce much friction against itself so 2 moving pieces back to back work well in acrylic
	>> Connects to bottom sheet
		> Custom 3D-printed L-bracket
	>> Rocker bogie ends terminated in 3mm screw holes for motor and servo mounts
>>> Rocker Bogie (New)
	>> Custom 3D printed parts visually based off of Sojourner mars rover
>>> Servo mount
	>> Built into new rocker bogie
	>> Servo is mounted directly under corners of rover reducing wheel base width
>>> Motor Mount
	>> Motor sits tight in mount
	>> Front and back wheels
		> 2 small holes connect motor mount to servo arm
		> Motor sits directtly under servo center of rotation
	>> Mid wheels
		>> Motor mount differs on mid wheels
			> Mid wheels do not turn so motor is mounted directly to rocker bogie
			> Motor mount is extended so to bring mid wheels in line with servo mounted front and back
